# This configuration file is used by the image_store_plugin.

# Set one or more thresholds that the image_store_plugin will
# use to determine the disposition of an image.  Threshold values
# are integers between 0 and 100.  The possible thresholds and 
# their meanings when an image has a score that exceeds the threshold 
# value:
#
#  Save - save the image file 
#  ReduceSave - reduce the image resolution and save
#  Delete - discard the image
#
# The highest score in an image's list of scores determines the 
# action.  If no 0 threshold is explicitly assigned, "Delete = 0" 
# is implicitly assigned.
